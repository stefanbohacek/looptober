# LOOPTOBER

Making music loops throughout every October!

[Reach out](https://stefanbohacek.com/contact/) to get your loops added!

## Make your own looptober page

1. Remix this project.
2. Update the file `_data/loops.json` with links to looptober loops. These will be sorted by year and then alphabetically by author's name within each year.
3. Add the "best of" tracks to the `public/loops` folder.
4. Update the `best_of.json` file with relative links of the uploaded tracks. Songs in the playlist will be sorted by their title.
5. Optionally update `content/index.md` and the template files inside `_includes`.
